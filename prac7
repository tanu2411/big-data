How To Install HBase in Ubuntu with Standalone
Mode
Here is the step by step process of HBase standalone mode installation in
Ubuntu:
Step 1) Place the below command
Place hbase-1.1.2-bin.tar.gz in /home/hduser
Step 2) Unzip it by executing command $tar -xvf hbase-1.1.2-bin.tar.gz.

It will unzip the contents, and it will create hbase-2.4.15 in the location
/home/hduser
Step 3) Open hbase-env.sh
Open hbase-env.sh as below and mention JAVA_HOME path in the location.
Step 4) Open the file and mention the path
Open ~/.bashrc file and mention HBASE_HOME path as shown in below
export HBASE_HOME=/home/hduser/hbase-2.4.15
export PATH= $PATH:$HBASE_HOME/bin

then
source ~/.bashrc
Step 5) Add properties in the file
Open hbase-site.xml and place the following properties inside the file
hduser@ubuntu$ sudo nano hbase-site.xml(code as below)
<property>
<name> hbase.rootdir</name>
<value>file:///home/hduser/HBASE/hbase</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir</name>
<value>/home/hduser/HBASE/zookeeper</value>

</property>
